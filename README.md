# Hello World ðŸ‘‹, I'm Danielle Davis /Peterson

an IT Analyst with a diverse background in technology and problem-solving, I have hands-on experience troubleshooting, updating software, and managing system imaging. I've played a key role for both a large-scale computer leasing project, supporting a seamless campus-wide OS installation and imaging process as well as a large-scale data entry project for a resort. With 15 years of experience across various roles, including inventory management and POS system maintenance, I've built a strong foundation in technical support and process optimization. Currently completing my bachelorâ€™s in computer science, Iâ€™ve gained Knowledge in software and web development, AI engineering, and coding in Python and C++. I have also completed a data analyst bootcamp where I learned MYSQL, Tableau, Power Bl, GCP, and AWS as it pertains to data analysis. My ability to collaborate effectively, think critically, and adapt quickly to new challenges drives my passion for continuous learning and improving technology solutions.
